I am a Data Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA. Prior joining to PNNL, I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Amarjeet Singh and Dr. Vikas Chandan in [Data Driven Thermostats: For Feedback, Comfort, and Reliability](https://repository.iiitd.edu.in/xmlui/handle/123456789/795) from Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi ([IIIT-Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/)). In my research work, I worked on analyzing multimodal sensory information to generate insights, and later use those insights to develop machine learning framework for real-world applications.

In my Ph.D., I collaborated with some of the top research labs across the world, including, [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), and [IBM Research Lab](https://research.ibm.com/labs/india). I visited the Optimization and Control Group at PNNL as an Alternate Sponsored Fellow on [IUSSTF BHAVAN Fellowship](https://iusstf.org/building-energy-efficiency-higher-advanced-network-fellowship) â€“ an initiative by the Government of India and the United States of America.
